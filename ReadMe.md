## About 
*Created By: Adam Lechliter*
### History
I started this project in May 2021 and worked on it for about a week to prepare for an upcoming internship at the time. The goal of the project was initially to practice using C# as well as practice better software design techniques. Since I had created a (very) rough 3D version of tetris a year earlier when teaching myself OpenGL with C++, I decided to recreate tetris again since I was already familiar with many of the mechanics and requirements of the project.

In May 2022, I returned to the project with a new set of goals.

1. Finish the initial console version of the game.
2. Refine the created interfaces and implementations into a reusable API that can allow for the easier creation of new Tetris games.
3. Use the API to create a web version of the game.
